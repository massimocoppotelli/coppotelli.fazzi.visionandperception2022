# DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION
This is the repository for the master's degree course in VISION AND PERCEPTION, held by Professor Irene Amerini and Professor Paolo Russo in La Sapienza.

## Project description

In this project, we aim to fine-tune a pretrained convolutional neural network to perform detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy. This disease has no cure at the moment, but there are therapies to slow down its development, that in the worst case can lead to blindness. These therapies are more likely to success if the disease is diagnosed early, hence a model that is able to perform the diagnosis would be helpful.
Using a dataset of images of the ocular fundus labeled with a number from 0 to 4, where 0 means healthy eye and 4 represents the most avanced stage of the disease, we fine-tune three different architectures (ResNet152, GoogLeNet and EfficientNet) to make them predict the label of the image.
